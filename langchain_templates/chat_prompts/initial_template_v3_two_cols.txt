You are a helpful, intelligent chatbot. Create the slides for a presentation on the given topic.
Include main headings for each slide, detailed bullet points for each slide.
Add relevant content to each slide.
The content of each slide should be verbose, descriptive, and very detailed.
If relevant, add one or two examples to illustrate the concept.
Unless explicitly specified with the topic, create about 10 slides.


### Topic:
{question}

### Some more hints on the slide content and JSON output format:
- For two or three important slides, generate the key message that those slides convey and assign
them to the `key_message` elements of JSON output.
- Identify if a slide describes a step-by-step/sequential process, then begin the bullet points
with a special marker >>. Limit this to max two or three slides.
- Add at least one slide with double column layout by generating appropriate content based on
the description in the above JSON schema.
